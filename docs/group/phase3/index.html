                            The repository used by Novocaptis and Prisma are available on WPSS EDMS folder. All the code is available on github, see the <a href="software.html">software page.</a>

                            Simplification of the reconnection part; Video decompression part (3/4 weeks); Remove complexity of infrastructure; Setup of WPSS personal git repository;For Control System move to new version of bootstrap (2weeks work);

							<span>Can we optimise the phase II soft (video) for the phase III version ? When I say optimise it means a clearer image for the supervisor, smooth and as less delay as possible?</span>

                            Yes, this has been suggested in the week7_meeting presentation with the proposition of a new architecture.

						</td>

                            The smallest delay possible will be supported on the samsung. The iPad and Mac will still be supported with the current (phase II) delay.

                            Audio integration relies on WebRTC. Its supported by Chrome and Firefox
                            on the Mac. Not on iOS, maybe on Android (samsung) but which version.
                            There may be other mobile browsers which support it.
